# Question:
# There are two deployments, Frontend and Backend
# Frontend is in the frontend namespace, Backend is in the backend namespace

# Task
# Look at the Network Policy YAML files in /root/network-policies
# Decide which of the policies provides the functionality to allow interaction between the
# frontend and the backend deployments in the least permissive way and deploy that yaml
