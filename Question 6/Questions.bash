# Question
# You're working in a kubernetes cluster with an existing deployment named busybox-logger running
# in the priority namespace.
# The cluster already has at least one user defined Priority Class

# Tasks:
# 1. Create a new Priority Class named high-priority for user workloads. The value of this class should
# be exactly one less than the highest existing user-defined priority class
# 2. Patch the existing deployment busybox-logger in the priority namespace to use the newly created
# high-priority class
