# Question:
# A user accidentally deleted the MariaDB Deployment in the mariadb namespace. The deployment
# was configured with persistent storage. Your responsibility is to re-establish the deployment
# while ensuring data is preserved by reusing the available PersistentVolume

#Task
# A PersistentVolume already exists and is retained for reuse. Only one PV exists
# Create a Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) named mariadb in the mariadb namespace with the spec
# Access Mode = ReadWriteOnce
# Storage = 250Mi
# Edit the MariaDb Deployment file located at ~/mariadb-deploy.yaml to use the PVC created in the previous step
# Apply the updated Deployment file to the cluster
# Ensure the MariaDB Deployment is running and Stable
